                  <span class="bold">Front-end Developer</span>, but sometimes I
                  morph into Full Stack mode üòÑ. I've been studying programming
                  on my own since 2018 and have been working professionally on
                  front-end development since mid-2021. I have a degree in
                  Systems Analysis and Development and also a previous
                  Engineering degree.

                      I started working on front-end web development as an

                      been studying programming and IT independently since 2018.

                      Soft skills can be fairly more valuable than hard skills
                      at the beginning of a career. Many complex hard skills can
                      be acquired within less than a few months, but to change a
                      person's character and behavior can take a lifetime.

                        I try to proactively plan before execution. Getting all

                        will quickly build up technical debt. On the other hand,
                        planning too much can be even worse. Balance between
                        proactive planning and execution is key.
