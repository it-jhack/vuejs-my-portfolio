                  My name is Thiago Amaral, I'm a Brazilian
                  <span class="bold">Front-end Developer</span>, but sometimes I
                  morph into Full Stack mode üòÑ. I've been studying programming
                  on my own since 2018 and have been working professionally on
                  front-end development since mid-2021. I have a degree in
                  Systems Analysis and Development and also a previous
                  Engineering degree.

                      Here are some examples of technologies that I have already
                      worked with:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                      <li>Vue.js</li>
                      <li>TypeScript (mostly) and JavaScript</li>
                      <li>JSON, Rest APIs, CORS</li>
                      <li>CSS and SCSS</li>
                      <li>Flexbox and Grid system</li>
                      <li>BootStrap Vue</li>
                      <li>Node.js (also in TypeScript)</li>
                      <li>MySQL and NoSQL</li>
                      <li>AWS Cloud Services</li>
                      <li>Google Tag Manager</li>
                      <li>jQuery</li>
                      <li>GitFlow, Agile and Scrum methodologies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      I started working as an intern in Front-end development in
                      June 2021, and was effectively hired in December of the
                      same year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although I work focused mainly on front-end, I have worked
                      in backend features and hotfixes on numerous occasions,
                      which gave me an overall good understanding of APIs, how
                      to better structure the front-end, and how to effectively
                      connect it to the back-end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One year of experience might not look like much, but I
                      feel that I've learned the equivalent of so much more
                      during this time. Time flies by when I code because I
                      absolutely love it. I guess that's the secret to learn
                      quickly in little time :D
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also have experimented with
                      <span class="bold">Bug Hunting</span>
                      in the past, which gave me a good general understanding of
                      web vulnerabilities. As described in the Projects section
                      of this page, during this period I developed a tool in
                      Python that can identify Subdomain Takeover
                      vulnerabilities.

                      Soft skills can be fairly more valuable than hard skills
                      at the beginning of a career. It takes only a few months
                      to train a person to do complex tasks, but to change a
                      person's character and behavior can take a lifetime.

                        I try to proactively plan before execution. Getting all
                        jobs done in any way as fast as possible is a trap that
                        will quickly build up technical debt. On the other hand,
                        planning too much can be even worse. Balance between
                        proactive planning and execution is key.

                        Time is the most valuable resource there is. There is
                        only a finite amount and we don't even know for sure how
                        much of it we got left. I constantly measure and
                        evaluate how I spend my time, seeking what can bring me
                        the best cost-benefit in the long run.

                        actually been complimented for being able to quickly
                        adapt to tools and languages I've never used before.
